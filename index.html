Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Choosing a topic to research.</h3>
              <p>The first step is naturally to decide what you want to look into. For example, Let's say you heard that there was once a huge flood that happened back in the day. Where did it happen? When? A quick search should yield this basic information. 
                In general, a source can be considered "historical" if it is older than 20 years from the current date. So, for this guide, we'll use the 1997 Reno flood as an example.</p>

                <p class="caption">This is really all you need to take notes, though the assistance of a computer can be especially helpful for citations.</p>
                <p>For a lot of modern research, you'll use something like a database. From your basic starting research in, say, Google, try to find keywords that might be of use to you.
              For our example, combinations like "Reno flood" or "reno water property damage" might yield interesting results. As you find these useful things, make sure to write them down in your notes!
              Especially, make sure to write down things like title and publishing information within your citation so they can be cited later if you need to do so.</p>

              <h3>Putting Sources Together: Primary and Secondary.</h3>
              <p>Historical sources generally come in two varieties. </p> 
                 <ul class=types of sources> 
              <li>Primary sources, direct accounts from those who witnessed the event right when it happened, and wrote something down or took a video. (Example: a newspaper article from the same week.) </li>
                   <li>Secondary sources, a later source where somebody discusses the event. (Example: this could be a scholarly article talking about how the flood changed property values in the city, or a list of things that were damaged.) </li>
              </ul>
           <p>Below is a short video which also helps to explain these different types of sources.</p>

              <p class="caption">This is a drawer of what's called "microfiche". Each card contains very tiny pictures of some sort of old document, newspaper, and so on, which allows libraries and archives to magnify them later and thus more easily store huge amounts of information in a small space. 
                Historians use resources like this constantly to gather the information they need.</p>
              <p>Now that you've collected a list of Primary and Secondary sources, read through them. Find quotes, facts, figures, and other useful elements you will want to use in your article. 
                For historical research, it's expected to use a primary and secondary source in tandem, with one reinfiorcing the other. Make sure to write these in your notes, while the citations are in your seperate citation notes.
                That way, everything somebody has mentioned can be linked to other confirmed sources of information, so people know that you or the people you are quoting aren't just making things up.

              <h3>Writing and Finishing the Article.</h3>
              <p>Now that you have all the historical things you want to use, take your notes and write them up so that they are easy to understand and interesting for your audiance. Think carefully here, about who your audiance is and what information they need.
                It's okay for certain details to not be included, if they just don't work or fit within the context of your article even if you find them really compelling. Also, it may be a good idea to mix historical and modern information, to help readers relate to what you've uncovered.
                When you're done, make sure to include all of the citations you've already made, using the information you've gathered. With that, Congratulations! If you have followed these steps, you have sucesfully used historical sources like a historian would use them.</p>
