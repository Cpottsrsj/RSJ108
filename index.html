Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

            <p>While many aspects of journalism focus on the here and now, history is an essential tool that gives us context for our current world. This guide will give advice on using these older sources for your own projects.</p>

              <h3>Choosing a topic to research.</h3>
              <p>The first step is naturally to decide what you want to look into. For example, Let's say you heard that there was once a huge flood that happened back in the day. Where did it happen? When? A quick search should yield this basic information. 
                In general, a source can be considered "historical" if it is older than 20 years from the current date.</p>

                <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/202609567@N02/54476028968/in/dateposted" title="Some Paper and a Pen"><img alt="Some scratch paper and a blue pen, sitting on a nice table" height="%" width="%" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54476028968_67d1808009_b.jpg" ></a>
                <p class="caption"><i>(This is really all you need to take notes, though the assistance of a computer can be especially helpful for citation notes.)</i></p>
                <p>For a lot of modern research, you'll use something like an online database or a library. From your very basic starting research, try to find keywords that might be of use to you.
                  For an example from some my research, I've looked into a specific mountain in Germany with many stories of witches and evil spirits on it. So, terms like the name of the mountain or towns nearby could help me figure out if these rumors have any truth to them.
                  As you find more robust information, make sure to write everything down in your notes!
                  For each source you want to use, make sure to write down things like the title and publishing information within your citation notes, so things can be cited later. This is crucial, as it allows your readers to use what you've found if they desire to do so. 
                  In fact, looking through another historian's citation notes can be a great way to gather information! (as long as you don't just copy all of their research, of course.)</p>

              <h3>Putting Sources Together: Primary and Secondary.</h3>
              <p>Historical sources generally come in two varieties. </p> 
                 <ul class=types of sources> 
              <li>Primary sources, direct accounts from those who witnessed the event right when it happened, and wrote something down or took a picture/video. (Example: a newspaper article from 1800's Germany, where a man saw a spirit while hiking and was terrfied.) </li>
                   <li>Secondary sources, a later source where somebody discusses the event. (Example: This could be a scientific article, saying that these mysterious mountain specters are actually an optical effect, created by high-altitude fog and specific light conditions.) </li>
              </ul>
           <p>You'll want sources that are legitimate, such as pictures or newspapers from the period itself, or peer-reviewed articles from reliable journals. Below is a short video which also helps to explain these different types of sources. </p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Reducing Information Down.</h3>
              <p>Now that you've collected a better list of primary and secondary sources, look through them a second time. Find quotes, facts, figures, and other useful elements you will want to use in your article. 
                For historical research, it's expected to use a primary and secondary source in tandem, with one reinforcing or explaining the other. Make sure to write these connections into your notes, while the citations are in your seperate citation notes.
                That way, everything somebody has mentioned can be linked to other confirmed sources of information, so people know that you or the people you are quoting aren't just making things up.

                 <p class="caption"><i>(This is a drawer of what's called "microfiche". Each card contains very tiny pictures of some sort of old document, newspaper, and so on, which allows libraries and archives to magnify them later and thus more easily store huge amounts of information in a small space. 
                Historians use resources like this constantly to gather the information that they need.)</i></p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Writing and Finishing the Article.</h3>
              <p>Now that you have all the historical things you want to use, use your notes and rewrite them so that they are easy to understand and interesting for your audience. Think carefully here, about who is reading your article and what information they need.
                It's okay for non-important details to not be included, if they just don't work or can't fit within the context of your article. Also, it may be a good idea to mix historical and modern information, to help readers relate to what you've uncovered.
                When you're done, make sure to include all of the citations you've already made, using your citation notes. With that, congratulations! By following these steps, you have sucesfully used historical sources like a historian would.</p>
